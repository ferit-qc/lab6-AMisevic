# Lab 6. Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks and Autoencoders

In this lab, you will dive into advanced quantum machine learning architectures by implementing Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) and Quantum Autoencoders (QAE) using Qiskit.

The lab guides you through:

Designing convolutional and pooling layers using parameterized quantum circuits to extract hierarchical features from quantum-encoded data.

Building a full QCNN architecture by stacking convolutional and pooling layers, combined with quantum feature maps for input encoding.

Implementing quantum autoencoders that compress and reconstruct quantum states via variational circuits and the swap test.

Training QCNNs and QAEs using classical optimizers such as COBYLA, with dynamic tracking of the objective function for performance monitoring.

Generating synthetic datasets (e.g., noisy digits zero and one) and preparing data for quantum encoding and classification tasks.

Evaluating model performance through fidelity calculations and visualizing reconstruction quality and classification outcomes.

Exploring hybrid quantum-classical workflows where quantum circuits perform complex transformations and classical algorithms optimize parameters iteratively.

Throughout this lab, you will develop practical skills in quantum circuit design, parameter optimization, and interpreting quantum model outputs, bridging quantum computing theory with real-world machine learning applications.
